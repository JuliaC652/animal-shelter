  <h1>Pick Your Pet!</h1>
  <p>
    Yo, even though you can't afford it, you should totally be responsible for another life.
    I mean, it's either you or this prison cell we call a "shelter" so now's the time to boost
    your ego by realizing that you aren't <em>literally</em> the <em>worst</em> thing in the world!
  </p>
  <p>Yeah...there you go champ. I bet your ego is boosted already! Now buy a shelter pet before we sell them to a hotdog factory.</p>
